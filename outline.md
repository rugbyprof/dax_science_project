# Playing Video Games Improves Memory

- The MST is a recognition memory task originally designed to tax the process of pattern separation (Kirwan and Stark, 2007). 
- The MST consists of an incidental encoding phase and a test phase (Fig. 1A) in which participants are shown color photos of objects.
